This section provides an overview of the current state of the art in deep learning for computer vision, including the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and attention mechanisms. It also discusses the challenges and limitations of deep learning in computer vision, such as the difficulty in interpreting the results of deep learning models and the need for large amounts of data to train the models. The authors then introduce the concept of knowledge distillation, which involves using a smaller, simpler model to learn from a larger, more complex model. This is followed by a discussion of the use of attention mechanisms in deep learning for computer vision, which allows the model to focus on important features in the image.

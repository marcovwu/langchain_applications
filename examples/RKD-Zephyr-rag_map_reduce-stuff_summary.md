The paper "Distilling Knowledge via Knowledge Review" proposes a new framework for knowledge distillation called ReviewKD, which focuses on the connection paths between the teacher and student networks. The authors reveal that the previously neglected importance of designing connection paths in knowledge distillation can significantly improve overall performance. The proposed framework uses low-level features in the teacher network to supervise deeper features for the student, resulting in improved student network performance for various tasks, including classification, object detection, and instance segmentation. The framework requires negligible computation overhead and outperforms other methods on a variety of tasks.

The concept of knowledge transfer through low-level features in teacher networks to improve student network performance is introduced. This technique, called low-level feature supervision, results in significant overall performance improvements. The authors further analyze the network structure and discover that the student's high-level stage has a high capacity to learn useful information from the teacher's low-level features. This process is similar to human learning, where a child initially comprehends only a small portion of knowledge taught and gradually understands and remembers more as they grow.

The paper discusses a new approach to knowledge distillation called "knowledge review". This method utilizes multi-level information from the teacher to guide one-level learning of the student network. The proposed framework, which includes a residual learning framework, an attention-based fusion module, and a hierarchical context loss function, has been shown to significantly improve the effectiveness of learning in various computer vision tasks. The authors suggest that this review mechanism is similar to the human practice of connecting knowledge learned at different stages during a period of study.

The given passage discusses the concept of knowledge distillation, which involves transferring knowledge from a teacher network to a smaller student network. The authors present two approaches to this problem: single-layer and multiple-layers knowledge distillation. The single-layer approach involves transferring features from the teacher to the student at a single layer, while the multiple-layers approach involves transferring features from multiple layers of the teacher to the student. The authors also introduce a review mechanism, which involves using previous features to guide the current feature. This mechanism is different from multiple-layers knowledge distillation, as it fixes the student's feature and uses the teacher's first levels of features to guide it. The authors present a loss function that combines the review mechanism with multiple-layers knowledge distillation. The paper also includes figures illustrating the architectures used in the experiments.

The section discusses a learning process called residual learning, which involves the student learning the difference between its predictions and the teacher's predictions for a specific stage of features. This residual information is crucial in improving the student's performance and yielding higher-quality results. The author argues that this residual learning process is more stable and effective than directly teaching the student high-level features.

The paper presents a knowledge distillation framework for deep neural networks, which aims to improve the performance of student networks by learning from the features of a teacher network. The framework consists of three key components: distillation, attention-based fusion (ABF), and hierarchical context loss (HCL). Distillation involves learning from the logits, single-layer, or multiple-layer features of the teacher network. ABF is a module that dynamically aggregates features from different levels of the network using attention maps. HCL is a loss function that transfers compound levels' information between features from different levels of the network. The framework is evaluated on the CIFAR-100 and ImageNet datasets, and the results show significant improvements in the performance of the student networks. The proposed framework is more effective than existing knowledge distillation methods, as it can learn from both low-level and high-level features of the teacher network and aggregate them more reasonably using attention maps.

In this section, the authors present the results of their method in two different tasks: image classification and object detection. They compare their method to other existing methods and report superior performance in both tasks. For image classification, they use the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet datasets and compare their method to previous state-of-the-art methods. They show that their method outperforms all other methods in terms of accuracy, with consistent advantages even when comparing different architectures. For object detection, they use the COCO2017 dataset and the popular open-source report Detectron2 as their baseline. They again show that their method outperforms the baseline, reducing the gap between the student and teacher models by 20% relative performance improvement. The authors provide more details about their method for object detection in the supplementary file. All performance is evaluated using the standard training policy.

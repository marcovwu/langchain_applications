The given text discusses various techniques for knowledge distillation, which involves transferring knowledge from a larger, more complex model (the teacher) to a smaller, simpler model (the student) in order to improve the performance of the student. The authors present four different architectures for this process, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. The first architecture supervises only one layer of the student network according to the review mechanism, while the second architecture directly generalizes from one layer to multiple layers. The third architecture optimizes the second architecture with fusion modules to obtain a more compact framework, and the fourth and final architecture improves upon the third architecture by utilizing residual learning in a progressive manner. The authors also introduce a new method for knowledge distillation called FusionNet, which utilizes the concept of residual learning to simplify the distillation process. The results of various experiments conducted on different datasets and architectures are presented, with the authors' method achieving the highest accuracy in most cases. The authors also discuss the application of knowledge distillation to instance segmentation using the Mask R-CNN model and the Detectron2 baseline, achieving state-of-the-art results. The section includes references to several research papers in the field of computer vision and deep learning, covering topics such as knowledge distillation, thin deep nets, and inverted residuals. Overall, the results suggest that knowledge distillation can be an effective way to improve the performance of smaller, simpler models without sacrificing accuracy.
